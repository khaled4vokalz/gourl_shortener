# URL Shortener in Go

This project is a URL Shortener service implemented in Go. It provides RESTful APIs to shorten long URLs and retrieve original URLs using a shortened identifier. The project uses an extensible design with support for multiple storage backends, caching, and configuration management. This is a Go üêπ learning project for me

## Features

- **Shorten URLs**: Generate a short, unique URL for any valid original URL.
- **Retrieve Original URLs**: Retrieve (get re-directed to) the original URL using the shortened identifier.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Default storage backend for rapid prototyping.
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Optional storage backend for persistence.
- **Caching with Redis**: Reduce database loads by caching
- **Environment Configurations**: Support for development and production environments.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily swap or add new storage backends.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.20+
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching (optional, but recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for persistent storage (optional)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) - optional
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - optional

## Running the app

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khaled4vokalz/gourl_shortener.git
cd gourl_shortener
```

- **Bare Metal:**

  - **install dependencies:**

  ```bash
  go mod tidy
  ```

  - **set up configuration:**
    create a configuration file in yaml format or use environment variables for settings like the port, database, and cache.
  - If you're using postgres as storage option, then run the `scripts/init-db-script.sh` script, so that needed schemas are created. Make sure to pass in the `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_NAME` envs.

  - **run the application:**

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

    if you don't have `make` you can alternatively use

    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/gourl_shortener
    ```

- **Docker**

  Just do `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-postgres-pass> DB_PASSWORD=<your-db-pass> docker compose up -d`, it should spin up the containers with needed database and tables in it. The application APIs will be exposed at port `8080`

## API Endpoints

### Shorten URL

**POST** `/shorten`

- without `Origin` header

  Request:

  ```bash
  curl --verbose --request POST --data '{"url": "http://example.com"}' localhost:8080/shorten
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  { "shortened_url": "http://localhost:8080/CBXqmaO8" }
  ```

- with `Origin` header

  Request:

  ```bash
  curl --verbose --request POST --header "Origin: https://foo.com" --data '{"url": "http://example.com"}' localhost:8080/shorten
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  { "shortened_url": "https://foo.com/CBXqmaO8" }
  ```

### Get Original URL

**GET** `/CBXqmaO8`

Response headers:

```sh
< HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
< Location: http://example.com
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be provided via YAML files or environment variables, currently it only supports config file in the `configuration` directory having the same name of the ENVIRONMENT env. Example YAML configuration:

```yaml
server:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
storage:
  type: postgres
  dbConnString: "user=shortener password=<pass> dbname=gourl_shortener sslmode=disable"
cache:
  enabled: true
  host: localhost
  port: 6379
  database: 0
shortenerProps:
  length: 6 # the total bytes that should be considered from the SHA256 hash of the url
  maxAttempt: 5 # maximum attempt the service should take when key collision happens for a url
environment: dev # the environment of the application, either `dev` or `prod`.
```

## Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
make test
```

If you don't have `make` you can alternatively use

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Roadmap

- [] Implement analytics for shortened URLs (e.g., number of clicks)
- [] Add expiration time
- [] Add a web UI for managing shortened URLs
- [x] Add support for Environment variables in the config files
- [x] Add docker support
- [x] Add logging
- [] Health-check
- [] House keeping
  - [] Provide default values for the configurations, probably my having a separate config manager
